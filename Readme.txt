These files are from my backups and range from anywhere from 2009 to 2014.

I wish i had more notes than.. uuh: At some point, i was setting up to build XNU and updating GCC
and libc/stc++ for Darwin 8/OSX 10.4.11 and apparently i also compiled llvm-gcc-4.2 that i forgot about. 
I seem to have all the original tar.gz files so an original branch can be made i suppose to see what on 
earth i did all those years ago on Darwin 8.

I also found a bunch of old DMG's im wondering what to do about, there amongst xcode and all that's requierd...

Noting this error adding the files - i uploaded what i found like gcc-5666 ages ago to github:
